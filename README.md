2. Adding Books:

   Click the "Add Book" button to open a dialog box with a form.
   Fill out the form with the title, author, number of pages, and read status of the new book.

   Click the "Submit" button to add the book to the library.

   Each book entry in the library includes a "Remove Book" button.

# JavaScript Implementation
The JavaScript file (script.js) contains the logic for managing the library. It uses an array myLibrary to store book objects, and functions such as getBooks, addBook, and removeBook handle the manipulation of the library array.

# HTML Structure
The HTML file (index.html) contains the structure of the webpage. It includes a grid layout for displaying books and a dialog box for adding new books.

# CSS Styling
The CSS file (styles.css) provides basic styling to make the interface visually appealing. It includes styles for the book cards, buttons, and the dialog box.

# How to Run
Simply open the index.html file in a web browser or the link preview provided above to use the library management system. Click the "Add Book" button to add new books, and interact with the "Remove Book" buttons to remove books from the library.

Feel free to customize and extend the system based on your requirements!
